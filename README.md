# Ocnus - A Heliospheric Modeling Framework

The **ocnus** crate attempts to leverage Rust's powerful type system to provide a flexible approach that aims to simplify the implementation of empirical or numerical heliospheric models and streamline the application of algorithms. The current model domain is primarily focused on magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) or solar wind models.
